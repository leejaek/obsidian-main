- [x] [Structure your notes with Markdown](things:///show?id=KPAthzGiHP9ohUaE2AMngw)
	- Things supports Markdown for adding structure and style to your notes.
	- If you don‚Äôt know Markdown, here‚Äôs how it works. To emphasize a word, simply surround it with asterisks, like so: *emphasized*. As you can see, Things detects this and displays the word in italics. If you remove those asterisks, it will go back to normal.
	- Here are a few more examples:
	- - Use two asterisks to make text **bold**
	- - Use colons to ::highlight text::
	- - Insert ‚Äú#‚Äù at the beginning of a line to make a heading, like so:
	- # This is a heading
	- ---
	- Markdown is a bit quirky, but it‚Äôs great for quickly styling your text while you type. You can also use keyboard shortcuts, which you can find in Edit ‚Üí Markdown.
