## Highlights
- Many beginner self taught developers miss programming fundamentals taught in University üéì
  Here is a curated list of topics that university covers in computer science

- 1. Data structures 
  You use data structures to store and organize data. ‚úçÔ∏è
  Different data structures store data in different ways üßä . Choosing the right type of data storage for the job will optimize your program.

- 2. Analysis of Algorithms
  You use analysis of algorithms when you need to optimize your code. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
  Basically, it allows you to evaluate the complexity/speed of any given program. üíª

- 3. NP-completeness
  You use NP-completeness to spot problems that are too hard. üí£
  Some problems can't be solved programmatically in a reasonable amount of time. Knowing NP-completeness helps you spot these problems. üîç

- 4. Object-Oriented Programming
  OOP teaches you the fundamentals of languages like Java, Solidity, etc. 
  Once you learn OOP, you can pick up on any language that uses OOP quite easily.

- 5. Algorithms 
  You use algorithms to help you solve problems üîç
  Most complex problems you run into can be solved using some type of known algorithm (e.g. Greedy, Recursive, etc). These algorithm types are taught in school.

- 6. Software Design 
  You use software design to create software efficiently. ‚úçÔ∏è
  Sometimes it can help to follow a known "software development life cycle" when you are creating complex software. üõ†Ô∏è

- 7. Discrete maths 
  You learn discrete maths to help you think logically. üß†
  Discrete maths is not like calculus. It is a type of maths dedicated to logic. You can be a good programmer without it though.

- 8. Test-Driven Design
  You use TDD to avoid difficult bugs. üêú
  TDD is the practice of testing your code whenever possible. You finish a small function, and then immediately write a test for it. It can save a lot of time ‚è∞
